1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of implementing a stack using arrays compared to linked lists?  

        Array-based Stack:

            Advantage: Simple to implement, easy access to elements.
            Disadvantage: Size has a limited capacity.

        Linked List-based Stack:
            Advantages: Capacity is higher, so there is no need to worry for the Size
            Disadvantages: Takes a bit more memory because each item has to store a reference.

2. What happens if you try to push an element into a full array-based stack? How can you handle this situation?  
        Trying to push into a full array will cause an error called StackOverflowError. To fix it you can show a message saying "the array is full" or increase the array's size

3. Which implementation is more efficient in terms of time complexity for push and pop operations? Explain.  

4. What is the output of the main method in the test class?  
        Array-based stack:
            Top element: 30  
            Size: 3  
            Popped element: 30  
            Is stack empty? false  

        Linked List-based stack:
            Top element: 300  
            Size: 3  
            Popped element: 300  
            Is stack empty? false
